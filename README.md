# Snippet Shelf

Snippet Shelf is a powerful, cloud-native platform for developers to store, manage, and share code snippets. Built on a robust microservice architecture, it's designed for scalability, resilience, and performance.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Snippet Management**: Create, edit, delete, and tag code snippets with syntax highlighting.
* **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in using JWT-based authentication.
* **Collections & Teams**: Organize snippets into personal or team-based collections for easy collaboration.
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Event-driven architecture using Kafka for generating activity feeds, analytics, and notifications.
* **Advanced Search**: Full-text search capabilities across all snippets powered by Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.
* **Scalable by Design**: Each component is a separate microservice, allowing for independent scaling and deployment.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

Snippet Shelf is built using a microservice architecture. The system is composed of several independent services that communicate with each other through a combination of synchronous (gRPC) and asynchronous (Apache Kafka) protocols. An API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests.

# üß© Microservices Overview

## Services

### **Auth Service**
- Manages user sign-up/sign-in
- Handles user profiles
- Issues JWT tokens

### **Snippet Service**
- Core service for CRUD operations on snippets and tags

### **Collection Service**
- Manages collections of snippets

### **Team Service**
- Handles team creation, membership, and permissions

### **Activity Service**
- Creates and manages user activity feeds from events

### **Analytics Service**
- Aggregates usage data and provides insights

### **API Gateway**
- Single entry point for routing, authentication, and rate limiting

### **Search Service**
- Provides full-text search capabilities

# üìÑ API Documentation & Endpoints

The **API Gateway** exposes an **OpenAPI specification** for exploring the public REST endpoints.  
Once the services are running, you can access the interactive documentation via **Swagger UI**.
